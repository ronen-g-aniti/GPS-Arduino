## GPS-Arduino Interface

This project demonstrates interfacing an Arduino with a GPS sensor to extract and display location data (latitude, longitude, and altitude). It showcases my ability to develop and integrate embedded systems for real-time data acquisition and analysis, aligning with my expertise in autonomous systems and algorithm development. 

This skillset is crucial in my work on autonomous flight technologies, where precise location tracking and navigation are paramount for ensuring mission success. 

### Hardware Requirements

* Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
* GPS module with UART interface (ensure compatibility)
* Jumper wires

### Software Requirements

* Arduino IDE
* TinyGPS++ library (install through the Arduino Library Manager)

### Code Overview

The provided Arduino code utilizes the SoftwareSerial and TinyGPS++ libraries to:

1. **Establish Serial Communication:**
    * Initialize serial communication with the computer for data display (Serial).
    * Initialize software serial communication with the GPS module (SoftwareSerial).

2. **Decode GPS Data:**
    * Continuously read incoming data from the GPS module.
    * Utilize the TinyGPS++ library to decode the received NMEA sentences and update GPS object properties.

3. **Extract and Display Location Data:**
    * Check if location (latitude, longitude) and altitude data have been updated.
    * If updated, print the extracted values to the serial monitor.

### Future Enhancements

* **Data Logging:** Implement data logging to an SD card for offline analysis.
* **Integration with Navigation Algorithms:** Integrate the acquired GPS data with path planning and navigation algorithms for autonomous systems.
* **Real-time Visualization:** Transmit the data wirelessly and visualize the location on a map in real-time.

This project serves as a foundational step towards building more complex navigation and autonomous systems.  I am committed to continually refining my skills and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in this dynamic field.
